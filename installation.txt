# Step 1: Initialize a Node.js project
# This creates package.json
npm init -y

# Step 2: Install TypeScript (development dependency)
# TypeScript is only needed during development, not in production
npm install -D typescript

# Step 3: Install ts-node (development dependency)
# ts-node allows you to run .ts files directly without compiling first
npm install -D ts-node

# Step 4: Create tsconfig.json
# This file controls how TypeScript compiles your code
npx tsc --init


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
🔹 What “without compiling first” actually means
Normal TypeScript flow (classic way)

TypeScript cannot run directly in Node.
So normally you do two steps:

# Step 1: Compile TypeScript → JavaScript
npx tsc

# Step 2: Run the compiled JavaScript
node dist/index.js


📌 This is called compiling first.

What ts-node / tsx does

When we say:

“run TypeScript without compiling first”

it means:

👉 You do NOT manually run tsc
👉 No dist/ folder is created
👉 No .js files are written

Instead:

npx ts-node src/index.ts
npx tsx .\src\1-Annotations\notes\index.ts


Behind the scenes:

TypeScript code is compiled in memory
The generated JavaScript is immediately executed
Nothing is saved to disk

So it feels like TS is running directly — but it’s actually JS in disguise.

🧠 Is this a good thing?
✅ YES — for development

Why it’s good during dev:

Benefit	Why it matters
Faster	No build step
Cleaner	No dist folder spam
Simple	One command
Great DX	Ideal for learning & testing

That’s why we use:

ts-node

tsx

❌ NO — for production

Why it’s bad in production:

Problem	Reason
Slower startup	Compilation happens at runtime
More memory	Compiler stays loaded
Risky	Runtime compilation = failures
Not standard	Prod expects JS, not TS

🚨 Never deploy ts-node to production

🔥 The golden rule (remember this)

ts-node / tsx = development only
tsc + node = production

🔁 Real-world workflow (used by companies)
During development
npm run dev
# runs tsx or ts-node

For production
npm run build   # tsc
npm start       # node dist/index.js

🧪 Visual mental model
DEV:
TypeScript ──► (ts-node / tsx, in memory) ──► Node

PROD:
TypeScript ──► tsc ──► JavaScript files ──► Node

tsc stands for TypeScript Compiler. It is a command-line tool that compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript code.

🧠 Why beginners get confused

Because it looks like TS is running directly — but it never does.

Node only understands JavaScript.
